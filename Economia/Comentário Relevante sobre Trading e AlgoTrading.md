It’s of course a good idea to not blindly believe these kinds of backtests but I just want to comment that a performance like that is definitely possible with an account of that size. The profit factor and the amount of trades are very reasonable for someone who just trades one contract of nq. I personally started trading more than 10 years ago and am now a full time and consistently profitable trader with similar stats (slightly higher profit factor, slightly fewer trades per day). The reason why funds can’t have this kind of performance is simply that the amount of money they manage is much higher. So they can’t use the same strategies that you could use while only trading 1 contract.

> Thanks for sharing this. I appreciate it a ton. Maybe i need a couple more examples or case studies or so. Are you aware of other people publishing these metrics/their approaches anywhere?

It’s really difficult to find information on this. The issue really is that so many traders lie about their performance. And some of them put a lot of effort to make their results believable. Usually because they plan to make money from selling courses. So unfortunately I also wouldn’t know where you could find backtests that are 100% proven to be accurate.

In fact it took me a few years to become profitable at trading and I believe the main reason for that is that I was trying to follow strategies that YouTubers and other traders shared online. Imagine you try to make money by copying a strategy that’s supposed to make money and somehow it doesn’t work but everyone online tells you that it’s just because of your psychology and because you execute the strategy wrongly. At some point you kinda start to believe that and you just waste months or years trying to make a strategy that is unprofitable work. it’s really problematic and it’s difficult to find a strategy that really works.

I personally actually became profitable only once I stopped to believe anything that I saw online and once I started backtesting ideas that I had myself.

The only interesting fact on the performance that I can share is that even Warren Buffet says that he could easily make 50% a year or more by investing if all he had were a few million dollars. With his current account size however that’s impossible.

Now the performance of this backtest is of course even much better but that’s simply because trading on small accounts can make much more money than investing the same amount. Generally speaking I would say making up to a million dollars per year trading is very doable and it doesn’t require a large account. After that it gets much more difficult and it depends on your exact strategy and which instruments you are trading.

So in the end even if you have a 10mil usd account you might make the same amount of money trading as you previously made with a 500k usd account, simply because you can’t increase your position size any further without suffering way too much slippage. And percentage wise of course making a mil usd a year is much more impressive on a 500k usd account than it is on a 10mil usd account.

If you look at this backtest specifically he traded 1 contract nq when the account was only at 5k usd and he still traded 1 contract nq years later when the account was at a few hundred k usd. The percentage gain in the first few months is therefore of course way different from that in the last few months.

>A lot of it makes sense and i went down the same rabbithole with people saying that my psychology was wrong or I didnt execute properly or maybe the broker didnt execute blaming just anything and everything besides the obvious, the lack of alpha in the underlying strategy. Honestly, these youtube and trader guru psychology and bad execution arguments are probably among the worse scams I have seen.

>I godda find that quote from Buffet. That sounds really interesting and i tend to believe what that man says.

>If you dont mind, whats your stack looking like? Do you do algo trading? Do you use python? How do you test or backtest your ides? How do you deploy etc?

Yes exactly! It’s kinda crazy how the majority of traders on Reddit seems to believe that you will automatically make money as long as your psychology is good and your RR is at least 2:1 ..

I currently trade 3 different strategies that are all traded manually. However I used trading algorithms in the past, mostly when I found opportunities for arbitrage trading. Actually also an interesting topic that shows that crazy percentage returns are possible with a small account.

So when I say my performance is currently similar to the one shared here it’s by trading manually, not by using an algorithm. However that shouldn’t matter and I don’t see why it wouldn’t be possible to have the same results after successfully automating everything.

That being said I have a degree in computer science and worked as a data scientist in the past so algotrading is always a big interest of mine and I’m sure I will deploy some more algorithms in the future. It’s just that in many cases I find it easier to trade an edge by myself than to create an algorithm to automate the whole process.

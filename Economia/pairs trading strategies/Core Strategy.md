- The core strategy in the co-integration approach, as described in the book "Appreciating" by [[Vidya Murthy]], involves a three-step framework: pre-selecting potential pairs, testing their tradability, and optimizing target levels to maximize expected returns.
- While the original strategy didn't explicitly require co-integration testing, it relied on a strong mean-reverting property, highlighting the flexibility of the approach.
- The second part of the strategy focuses on identifying pairs with a strong mean-reverting property, which is a key characteristic for successful [[Pairs trade | pairs trading]].

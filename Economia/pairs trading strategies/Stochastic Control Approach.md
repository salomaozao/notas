## Stochastic Control Approach [(00:24:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1454s)


- The stochastic control approach utilizes [[Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process | Ornstein-Uhlenbeck]] (OU) process-based models to analyze the spread between two assets. This approach assumes the spread follows a specific stochastic process, incorporating factors like trader expectations, market volatility, and other relevant inputs.
- These models can be used to determine optimal weights for the assets in the spread, as well as potential entry and exit levels for trades. The models also allow for the incorporation of different utility functions, reflecting the specific objectives and risk tolerance of the trader.
- Notably, these models demonstrate that it is not always optimal to enter a trade. There may be situations where it is more advantageous to remain out of the market, a concept that will be further explored in the following presentation.

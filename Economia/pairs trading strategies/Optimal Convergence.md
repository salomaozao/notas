## Optimal Convergence [(00:25:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1540s)


- The "Optimal Convergence" strategy, as outlined by Liu and Timmerman, expands upon previous models by considering not only the spread between two assets but also the individual price movements of each asset, incorporating various factors into a complex model.
- This strategy identifies two distinct trading opportunities: recurring and non-recurring. Recurring opportunities allow for multiple trades, accumulating profits over time, while non-recurring opportunities offer a single, potentially high-yield trade.
- The model challenges traditional [[Pairs trade | pairs trading]] logic by suggesting that, in certain scenarios, it may be profitable to hold both assets in a pair (either long or short) or to hold only one asset while not holding the other.

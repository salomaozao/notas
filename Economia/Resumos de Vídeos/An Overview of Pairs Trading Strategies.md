- This chapter of the video focuses on the literature surrounding pairs Trading strategy | trading strategies, acknowledging that the field is vast and only core papers are being highlighted.
- The presenter emphasizes that the chosen papers are those that will be implemented, showcased, and discussed in the video.
- The presenter encourages viewers to use tools like "connected papers" to explore the broader literature if they wish to delve deeper into the subject.



## Structure [(00:06:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=367s)


- Pairs trade | Pairs trading strategies are categorized based on their approach, nature, and logic. Christopher Krause proposed five distinct approaches to pairs trading: distance, co-integration, time series, stochastic control, and other approaches.
- The distance approach utilizes simple non-parametric distance metrics and rules to generate trading signals. This approach involves calculating the distance between the prices of two assets and using thresholds to determine trading opportunities.
- The co-integration approach requires stricter co-movement of assets or portfolios. This approach involves testing for co-integration between the assets and using the results to generate trading signals.



## Distance Basic [(00:12:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=755s)


- Distance Basic Strategies: The chapter discusses the "Distance Basic" strategy, a simple and robust algorithm for pairs trading. This strategy, originally proposed by Gatev et al., involves identifying pairs of stocks with a historically stable price relationship and exploiting deviations from this relationship. While initially showing high returns, the profitability of this approach has declined since 2005, especially when considering transaction costs.
- Adjustments and Extensions: Researchers have proposed adjustments to the original Distance Basic strategy, which have shown improved returns and profitability. These adjustments include using alternative metrics like Pearson's correlation to identify pairs and adapting the strategy to specific market conditions.
- Quasi-Multivariate Extension: The chapter also mentions a quasi-multivariate extension of the Distance Basic strategy. This extension uses multiple metrics to identify pairs, resulting in more robust results and improved performance over a broader backtesting timeframe.



## Cointegration [(00:15:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=944s)


- The chapter discusses the co-integration approach to Pairs trade | pairs trading.
- To gain a deeper understanding of co-integration, viewers are encouraged to watch Ethan's YouTube videos on minimum profit optimization and sparse mean-reverting portfolios.
- These videos provide a comprehensive explanation of the concept of co-integration, which is essential for understanding the pairs Trading strategy | trading strategy discussed in the webinar.



## Core Strategy [(00:16:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=972s)


- The core strategy in the co-integration approach, as described in the book "Appreciating" by Vidya Murthy, involves a three-step framework: pre-selecting potential pairs, testing their tradability, and optimizing target levels to maximize expected returns.
- While the original strategy didn't explicitly require co-integration testing, it relied on a strong mean-reverting property, highlighting the flexibility of the approach.
- The second part of the strategy focuses on identifying pairs with a strong mean-reverting property, which is a key characteristic for successful Pairs trade | pairs trading.



## Minimum Profit Optimization [(00:17:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1021s)


- Minimum profit optimization strategies aim to maximize the worst-case scenario in trading by optimizing the minimum profit achievable.
- These strategies involve a training period where the spread of the trading pair is observed, and optimal entry and exit levels are determined to maximize the expected minimum value of the trade.
- While the original paper focused on profit per trade, a subsequent paper addressed the critique that it neglected the number of trades, proposing a more adjusted framework. However, this approach requires a specific configuration error to be a symmetric AR1 process and has a high computational complexity.



## Sparse Min Revert Portfolios [(00:19:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1154s)


- Sparse min reverting portfolios, while not explicitly described in the original Krauss paper, are a crucial element of pairs Trading strategy | trading strategies and are of great interest to practitioners.
- This approach deviates from standard co-integration testing for determining trading weights, as it aims to create sparse portfolios with minimal elements, reducing transaction costs and improving interpretability.
- The method involves utilizing the correlation matrix of assets to generate a sparse mean reverting portfolio, which can be achieved through either a greedy search or a convex relaxation approach, with the latter offering better results but requiring more processing time.



## Time Series Approach [(00:21:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1278s)


- The time series approach to Pairs trade | pairs trading is still under development, but it offers promising potential. The Kalman filter, a key component of this approach, will be discussed in detail in a future video.
- The core idea behind the time series approach is to model the spread between two assets as a state space model. This model's parameters can be estimated using the Kalman filter. The approach then forecasts the spread's future value and applies filters to generate trading signals.
- There are various types of filters that can be used, ranging from simple threshold filters to more complex methods like adding and fernstein will and back. The choice of filter depends on the specific Trading strategy | trading strategy and desired level of complexity. The text also mentions a textbook by Sarmanto and Horta, which presents a versatile approach that combines forecasting algorithms with quantile-based signal generation. This method allows for adjusting the sensitivity of the trading signals by changing the quantile threshold.



## Stochastic Control Approach [(00:24:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1454s)


- The stochastic control approach utilizes Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process | Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process-based models to analyze the spread between two assets. This approach assumes the spread follows a specific stochastic process, incorporating factors like trader expectations, market volatility, and other relevant inputs.
- These models can be used to determine optimal weights for the assets in the spread, as well as potential entry and exit levels for trades. The models also allow for the incorporation of different utility functions, reflecting the specific objectives and risk tolerance of the trader.
- Notably, these models demonstrate that it is not always optimal to enter a trade. There may be situations where it is more advantageous to remain out of the market, a concept that will be further explored in the following presentation.



## Optimal Convergence [(00:25:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1540s)


- The "Optimal Convergence" strategy, as outlined by Liu and Timmerman, expands upon previous models by considering not only the spread between two assets but also the individual price movements of each asset, incorporating various factors into a complex model.
- This strategy identifies two distinct trading opportunities: recurring and non-recurring. Recurring opportunities allow for multiple trades, accumulating profits over time, while non-recurring opportunities offer a single, potentially high-yield trade.
- The model challenges traditional Pairs trade | pairs trading logic by suggesting that, in certain scenarios, it may be profitable to hold both assets in a pair (either long or short) or to hold only one asset while not holding the other.



## Optimal Mean Reversion [(00:26:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1618s)


- The chapter discusses "Optimal Mean Reversion Trading," a strategy not included in the original Kraus overview but considered a standalone element. This strategy is based on the assumption that the spread process follows a specific distribution, with three common models being the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process | Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model.
- The first textbook mentioned, by Professor Leung and Lee, proposes optimal levels for this strategy. By providing training data for the spread, along with parameters like stop-loss ratios, trading constraints, and transaction costs, the model outputs optimal entry and exit levels for maximizing profitability. This approach can be applied to both single-opportunity and multiple-opportunity Trading strategy | trading strategies.
- The second paper, by Professor Lipton and Prado, takes a different approach but also assumes a specific distribution for the spread, such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. By solving the problem from a different perspective, this paper also provides optimal levels for trading, contributing to the overall understanding of optimal mean reversion strategies.



## Optimal Levels [(00:29:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1758s)


- The chapter discusses the transition from a stochastic control approach to a Machine learning | machine learning approach for determining optimal levels in Pairs trade | pairs trading.
- The speaker acknowledges that the information presented may be overwhelming and encourages viewers to ask questions after the presentation.
- The chapter serves as an introduction to the field of pairs trading for beginners.



## Machine Learning Approach [(00:29:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1777s)


- Machine learning approaches to pairs trading are similar to time series methods, but offer a structured framework for finding suitable pairs. This approach involves three steps: dimensionality reduction to create a compact representation of assets, unsupervised learning clustering to group similar assets, and pair selection based on criteria like Cointegration | cointegration tests, spread deviation, and frequency of trading opportunities.
- Several papers by Dunis and other researchers explore this approach, focusing on specific spreads like gasoline, soybean, corn, and ethanol. These papers often utilize Machine learning | machine learning models, particularly neural networks, to model the spread and generate trading signals.
- The framework typically involves filtering the forecasted spread using a symmetrical or asymmetrical filter, which considers the expected value and actual value to generate trading signals. This approach often incorporates the threshold autoregression model to adjust the trading process based on the spread's behavior.



## Copula Approach [(00:33:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=1996s)


- The chapter discusses the "copula approach" to Pairs trade | pairs trading, a method that is explained in detail in two blog posts titled "Introduction to Basic Copulas for Pair Trading" and "Introduction to Advanced Copulas for Pair Trading."
- These blog posts, available on the Hudson Thames website and YouTube channel, provide comprehensive information on copulas and their application in pairs trading.
- While the concept of copulas might seem complex, it is a valuable tool for pairs trading as recent research suggests that it can lead to more robust results and higher excess returns in certain trading scenarios.



## Basic Copula Strategies [(00:34:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=2051s)


- Basic Copula Strategies: These strategies utilize copulas, which are mathematical tools for representing the relationship between two assets. They involve a training period where the best-fitting copula is determined based on historical data. During trading, the copula model helps identify potential price discrepancies, suggesting when one asset is underpriced and the other is overpriced. This approach can be enhanced by incorporating a pricing index, as demonstrated by Shia Islam | Shia and colleagues.
- Vine Copula Strategies: Vine copulas are an extension of basic copulas, offering improved pair selection and Trading strategy | trading strategies. They provide a more sophisticated way to analyze the relationships between assets. A key feature is that for each asset, the model identifies three potential trading partners. This approach has shown promising results in backtesting, demonstrating robust trading performance over extended periods.
- Further Exploration: The video encourages viewers to attend a future presentation for a deeper dive into vine copula strategies and their practical applications. Additional resources, including blog posts on the Hudson and Things website, are available for those interested in delving further into this complex topic.



## PCA Strategy [(00:37:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=2246s)


- Principal component analysis | PCA Strategy Overview: The PCA strategy, developed by Avalanche and Lee, focuses on decomposing asset returns into systematic and idiosyncratic components. This decomposition can be achieved by regressing asset returns against a market sector representative, such as a PCA eigen portfolio or sector Exchange-traded fund | ETFs.
- PCA Eigen Portfolio: A PCA eigen portfolio is created by calculating the eigenvectors of a correlation matrix of assets and adjusting them based on variance. This results in a set of weights that create a portfolio representing a natural split of the assets.
- Trading Signals: By analyzing the performance of the idiosyncratic component, which is modeled using a John Steinbeck | Steinbeck process, trading signals can be generated. This approach is considered quasi-multivariate as it involves trading one asset against a portfolio of other assets from the same sector. The strategy can be further refined by adjusting model parameters, such as fixing or not fixing the drift, and adjusting returns by volatility to filter out false positive signals.



## References [(00:40:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgU1lSdH3vM&t=2431s)


- The speaker acknowledges that there are many references available for further study on pairs Trading strategy | trading strategies, spanning approximately four pages. Some of these references include links to the original papers, allowing viewers to access them directly.
- The speaker realizes they forgot to share the link to the presentation in the chat and promises to do so after addressing questions. Viewers can then save the presentation for future reference.
- The speaker expresses gratitude for the audience's participation in the first day of the Pairs trade | pairs trading workshop and encourages them to attend the following day, as there is much more to cover. They also invite viewers to follow them and Hudson for more content on this topic. The speaker concludes by welcoming questions about the strategies, products, or any other relevant topics.

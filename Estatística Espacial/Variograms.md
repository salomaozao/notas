There is a third type of stationarity called ***intrinsic stationarity***. Here we assume E[Y (s +h) − Y (s)] = 0 and define

Equation (2.1) makes sense only if the left-hand side depends solely on h (so that the right hand side can be written at all), and not the particular choice of s. If this is the case, we say the process is intrinsically stationary.

p.25 - γ(h) is the semivariogram function
Vale lembrar que Cov( Z(s), Z(s)) = Var( Z(s)

2γ(h) é o variograma (variogram). Se prestarmos atenção acima, percebemos que a função se baseia na variação em função do vetor de deslocamento ***h***

Behaviorally, at short distances (small||h||), we would expect Y (s + h) and Y (h) to be very similar, that is, (Y (s + h) − Y (s))² to be small. As ||h|| grows larger, we expect less similarity between Y (s + h) and Y (h), i.e., we expect (Y (s + h) − Y (s))2 to be larger. So, a plot of γ(h) would be expected to increase with ||h||, providing some insight into spatial behavior

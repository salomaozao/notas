üìñ **As mentioned in Chapter 1**

the fundamental concept underlying the theory is a stochastic process {Y (s) : s ‚àà D}, where D is a fixed subset of r-dimensional Euclidean space. 

For situations where r > 1, the process is often referred to as a ***spatial process***

**For example**, Y (s) may represent the level of a pollutant at site s. While it is conceptually sensible to assume the existence of a pollutant level at all possible sites in the domain, in practice the data will be a partial realization of that spatial process. That is, it will consist of measurements at a finite set of locations, say {s1, . . . , sn}, where there are monitoring stations. The problem facing the statistician is inference about the spatial process Y (s) and prediction at new locations, based upon this partial realization

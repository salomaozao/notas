# 1.1 Introdução
Following convention, we classify spatial data sets into one of **three basic** **types**:
• **point-referenced data**, where Y (s) is a random vector at a location s ∈ r, where s **varies continuously** over D, a fixed subset of r that contains an r-dimensional rectangle of positive volume;

*also called geocoded or geostatistical*

**Point-referenced é CONTÍNUO**

### **Point-level models:**

In the case of point-level data, the location index s varies continuously over D, a fixed subset of R^d

- A covariância entre dois pontos depende da distância entre eles

Adding a joint distributional model to these variance and covariance assumptions thenenables likelihood inference in the usual way. The most convenient approach would be toassume a multivariate normal (or Gaussian) distribution for the data. That is, suppose weare given observations Y ≡ {Y (si)} at known locations si, i = 1,...,n. We then assumethatY | μ, θ ∼ Nn(μ1 , Σ(θ)) , (1.1)where Nn denotes the n-dimensional normal distribution, μ is the (constant) mean level,1 is a vector of ones, and (Σ(θ))ii- gives the covariance between Y (si) and Y (si- ). For thevariance-covariance specification of the previous paragraph, we have θ = (τ 2, σ2, φ)T , sincethe covariance matrix depends on the nugget, sill, and range

**CALCULO DA COVARIANCIA SIGMA**

In fact, the simplest choices for Σ are those corresponding to isotropic covariance func-tions, where we assume that the spatial correlation is a function solely of the distancedii- between si and si- . As mentioned above, exponential forms are particularly intuitiveexamples. Here,(Σ(θ))ii- = σ2 exp(−φdii- ) + τ 2I(i = i-), σ2 > 0,φ> 0, τ 2 > 0 , (1.2)where I denotes the indicator function (i.e., I(i = i-) = 1 if i = i-, and 0 otherwise).

ou seja, cov(vi, vi’) = E, e ha vários metodos para calcula la

• **point pattern data**, where now D is itself random; its index set gives the locations of random events that are the spatial point pattern. Y (s) itself can simply equal 1 for all s ∈ D (indicating occurrence of the event), or possibly give some additional covariate information (producing a marked point pattern process).

**Point pattern é DISCRETO**

Questions of interest with data of this sort typically center on whether the data are
clustered more or less than would be expected if the locations were determined completely by chance

### Point process models

Questions of interest with data of this sort typically center on whether the data are
clustered more or less than would be expected if the locations were determined completely
by chance. Stochastically, such uniformity is often described through a homogeneous Poisson
process, which implies that the expected number of occurrences in region A is λ|A|, where
λ is the intensity parameter of the process and |A| is the area of A.

the K function then divides out the average intensity λ. However, **if the data are clustered we might expect K(d) > πd2, while if the points follow some regularly spaced pattern we would expect K(d) < πd2.** This suggests a potential inferential use for K

• **areal data**, where D is again a fixed subset (of regular or irregular shape), but nowpartitioned into a finite number of areal units with well-defined boundaries;

*is often referred to as lattice data*

- most areal data are summaries over an irregular lattice, like a collection of county

    Note that we have no information on any single household in the study area, only regional summaries for each region
    
    Figure 1.2 is an example of a choropleth map, meaning that it uses shades of color (or greyscale) to classify values into a few broad classes, 
    
    ### Aerial Models
    
    - CAR model is computationally convenient for Gibbs sampling used in conjunction with Bayesian model fitting, and in this regard is often used to incorporatespatial correlation through a vector of spatially varying random effects φ = (φ1,...,φn)T

💻 the *gstat* and *geoR* packages provide functions to perform analysis for **point-level** data; the latter also offers simpler Bayesian models. The packages *spBayes* and sptimer have much more elaborate Bayesian functions, the latter focusing primarily upon space-time data.

The *spdep* package in R provides several functions for analyzing **areal-level data**, including basic descriptive statistics for areal data as well as fitting areal models using classical likelihood methods. For Bayesian analysis, the *BUGS* language and the *WinBUGS* software is still perhaps the most widely used engine to fit areal models.
Turning to **point-process** models, a popular spatial R package, *spatstat***.** However, full inference likely requires use of the R package Splancs
